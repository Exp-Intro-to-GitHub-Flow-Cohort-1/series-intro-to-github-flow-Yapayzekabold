## Step 1: Creating Your First Branch

_Get started with GitHub by creating your first branch!_ :wave:

**What is GitHub?**: GitHub is a collaborative platform that utilizes _[Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git)_ for version control. It's a leading hub for sharing and contributing to [open-source](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source) software.

**What is a repository?**: A _[repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository)_ is a project containing files and folders, tracking versions of its contents. Find more details in the "[About repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)" section in GitHub Docs.

**What is a branch?**: A _[branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch)_ is a parallel version of your repository. The default branch is named `main` and is considered the primary one. Creating additional branches allows you to safely make changes without affecting the main project. This is especially useful for working on specific features. Learn more in the "[About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)" section.

**What is a profile README?**: A _[profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)_ serves as an "About me" section on your GitHub profile, letting you share information with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub displays your profile README at the top of your profile page. Get further insights in "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your First Branch

1. Open a new browser tab and go to your newly created repository. Follow the steps in your second tab while keeping these instructions open.
2. Click on the **< > Code** tab in your repository's header menu.

3. Open the main branch drop-down menu.

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. It's crucial to use this exact name to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to initiate the creation process.

   The branch will automatically switch to the newly created one. The main branch drop-down bar will now reflect your new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one with these instructions). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically progress to the next step.
